1. Main Layout
The clean, two-column layout separates the input form from the task list for a clear user experience.

2. Adding a New Task
Users can add tasks with an optional timestamp. The list updates instantly without a page refresh.

3. Interactive Elements
All buttons and input fields have hover and focus effects for better user engagement. The entire list is scrollable if the content overflows.

Features
Dynamic Task Management: Add and delete tasks in real-time.

Optional Timestamps: Add a specific due date and time to any task.

Persistent Data: All tasks are saved to localStorage, so your list is preserved even after closing the browser.

Reset Functionality: A "Reset All" button allows the user to clear all tasks from the list and from storage.

Efficient Event Handling: Uses event delegation to efficiently manage delete events for all tasks.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

Engaging UI/UX: Features a unique two-column design with custom styling, hover effects, and smooth transitions.
